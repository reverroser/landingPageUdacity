# Landing Page Project

This is the second project of the Frontend Development nanodegree from Udacity.

This project was done following the guidlines in the exercise desciption and taking [udacity's seed repo](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) as starting point.

This is a mock project to practice generating content dynamically, scrolling to anchors and apply smooth scrolling in Javascript.

## Usage

To run this project, you just need to open the index.html file in your browser.
